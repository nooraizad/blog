Welcome to nooraizad.com. My name is Muhammad Nooraizad. In this blog, I will be writing about data science, data analysis, personal project, my interest and personal lives. However, the content here will be focusing on data science as I have a deep interest in it. I enjoyed derive meaningful insight from data and presented the findings to the audience. Data science is an exciting field, and it keeps evolving every day as we are speaking. We can see many application of data science that helped us to solve real life problem. I will be sharing my works here, hoping it can be beneficial to readers and also for me to keep track things I have learned. 

I am based in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia and working in the information technology sector. I enjoyed reading fantasy genre novels, watching Netflix and spending my time with my family. I used to play Dota 2 a lot. Nowadays, I am not able to play as much as I wanted due to time limitation and now I enjoyed watching Dota 2 tournament. 

I am looking forward to connect with readers.
